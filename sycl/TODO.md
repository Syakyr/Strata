# SYCL port: speedup TODO

Ordered by how little card time each one needs to test. Measured numbers live in
[docs/INTEL_PERFORMANCE.md](../docs/INTEL_PERFORMANCE.md); each item is checked with benchy v1 (`sycl/benchy.sh`) and an
output-identity comparison against the build before it.

## 1. New hardware readiness (no card time)

The B70 trained at PCIe Gen3 x8 in the old host's slot (it can do Gen5 x16); the new host gives both cards Gen5 x8. IQ2_XS and Swift read their ~6,000
mirrored experts over that link at every decode step, and each start reads 30-43 GB from the SSD. A second card
lets a layer split hold the IQ2_XS without a host mirror.

- [x] Multi-card path checked without a second card (2026-10-04): `setup_intel.py --check` with two simulated
      cards now sizes models across both (it used the first card only) and names the Intel path; the config keeps
      `"gpu"`/`layer_split`, the server adds `--layer-split`, `strata-sycl.sh` opens the selector to every card,
      benchy reads every card. A second card of another die needs a two-target build (`AOT=bmg-g21,bmg-g31`,
      checked to compile).
- [x] On the new box (2026-10-04): benchy v1 with the same engine, B70 at Gen5 x8 on a Ryzen 9 9950X with 61 GB:
      IQ2_XS / Swift decode +15-30% and long prompts ~25% faster (the RAM mirror over a 26.5 GB/s link, 6.1 before),
      the Coder +15-40% prompt, +3% decode. The B65 alone: 70-77% of the B70 (INTEL_PERFORMANCE.md).
- [ ] With the second card: a layer split of the IQ2_XS (all experts resident) through setup and benchy.

## 2. Refill lent cache slots in the background (short-prompt test)

Above 32K context the prompt path borrows VRAM cache slots and refills them from the GGUF before the first decode
round: ~1 s per request (950 ms for 1,050 slots). With served 128K/256K configs that is most of the gap between a
2,185-token prompt at 479 tok/s and the 32K config's 790.

- [x] Done another way (2026-10-04, simpler and safer than refilling during decode): the lendable experts are
      mirrored in pinned RAM at start, so the prompt path DMAs them per chunk (it read them from the GGUF) and the
      refill copies from RAM (`STRATA_LEND_MIRROR=0` turns it off). Outputs identical (Coder 2,185 / 8K / 40K,
      IQ2_XS 2,185 / 8K, cold cache). Prompt reading Coder 456 -> 610 / 802 -> 946 / 988 -> 1,046 tok/s, IQ2_XS
      303 -> 500 / 565 -> 720; refill 720-2,240 -> 200-380 ms; Coder 2,185-token TTFT 4.74 -> 3.87 s. Costs 1.9-2.3
      GiB of RAM and ~2 s at start.
- [ ] Still open: decode before the refill lands (would take the remaining ~0.3 s off TTFT).

## 3. Long prompts (parity tests + 40K-256K runs)

At 40K: expert GEMMs 23%, attention 19%, dequant 16%, QSA select 7%, host grouping 6.5%, gather 6%.

- [x] **3a. Expert grouping on the GPU: not worth it** (measured 2026-10-04). Host timers over a 40K prompt's 528
      groupings: the loops 47 ms, the uploads 24 ms, and 2,336 ms the profiler's own event fold - the "6.5%" was
      mostly the measurement. The 26 s "drain wait" is the host waiting for GPU work it had queued, not idle GPU.
- [x] **3b. QSA block selection: done** (2026-10-04). The scores as oneMKL fp32 GEMM tiles plus a relu-sum
      (`sel_scores_bench`: 7.3-8.4x the per-pair kernel at 40K-256K, relative error 2-4e-7). Coder TTFT 256K
      328.6 -> 258.2 s (780 -> 992 tok/s), 128K 138.9 -> 122.9 s, 40K 38.4 -> 37.4 s; IQ2_XS 40K 762 -> 785 tok/s.
      Not bitwise (as the CUDA build's 3xTF32 path): outputs follow the same text and part at a near-tie after 13-93
      tokens, equally coherent. `STRATA_SELECT_GEMM=0`: the old kernel.
- [x] **3c. Prompt attention: done, 1.5x kernel / ~10% TTFT** (2026-10-04, 15 attempts in `attn_bench`, 32 queries x
      2,048 cells, INT8 KV, 131K context; the old kernel 0.57 ms):
      - kept: scores one work-item per cell with the query heads read from local memory, 128-cell chunks: 0.37 ms.
        Coder TTFT 40K 37.2 -> 33.5 s, 128K 123.0 -> 111.3 s, 256K 258.3 -> 235.1 s. `STRATA_ATTN_PERCELL=0`: old.
      - measured: the K/V gather alone is 0.07 ms (the selections share cells and stay in cache) - the kernel is
        arithmetic-bound; the values pass is ~60% of it now, ~0.14 ms of that its V reads.
      - no gain: SYCL's native sub-group reduction in the engine's order (1.03x), K staged in local memory (0.29x),
        64 / 256-cell chunks, 4 dims per work-item (spills: 0.56x), float4 weight loads, 4-byte V loads, V staged in
        local memory (0.54x), V scales in local memory, a V row pointer table, sub-group block reads (0.95x), two
        work-items per cell (0.91x).
      - XMX: the tree's v2 kernel 1.68 ms (120 KB of local memory: one work-group per core), a lean fp16 XMX values
        pass 1.6-2.1 ms; sub-group 16 alone costs only 0.05 ms, so the joint_matrix path itself loses here.

## 4. From another SYCL project on the same card (a video model's port, 2026-10-05)

Its measurements on the B70, which Strata's own benches never matched:

- [x] **oneDNN against oneMKL for the prompt path's GEMMs: measured** (2026-10-05, `onednn_gemm_bench`, B70; the
      other project's quoted rate was at different shapes). oneMKL fp16 is not slow where it matters most: 128-147
      TFLOP/s on the dense projections at the 4,096-row chunk, and oneDNN fp16 matches it (1.00-1.14x). Two gaps:
      - **expert gate/up at 256-512 rows:** oneMKL drops to 28-32 TFLOP/s, oneDNN fp16 does 54-56 (1.8-1.9x, same
        precision); 1.0-1.3x at 64-128 rows; slower below 64 (0.6x at 16-32). A per-group switch by row count.
      - **int8 (s8 x s8, scales per tensor / column):** 1.6-2.4x on the dense projections (6144 -> 2560: 319 against
        132 TFLOP/s), 1.3-3.2x on expert shapes - GEMM alone; the activations' quantization and the weights' int8 form
        come on top.
      Prompt share at 40K: expert GEMMs 18%, QSA projections 16% (part of it GEMM), so a 2x GEMM is ~10-15% of TTFT.
- [ ] **oneDNN fp16 for expert groups of >= 128 rows** (lowest risk: the same fp16 inputs and fp32 accumulation).
      Needs oneDNN's headers in the dev image (`intel-oneapi-dnnl-devel`), and the rows per expert of real prompts
      (mean 80 at 4,096 tokens x 10 of 512 experts; skewed) to know the share above 128.
- [ ] **int8 for the dense projections (it wins on the GEMM, above):** its int8 linear as built there - a Hadamard rotation of
      activations and weights (groups of up to 256) so int8 keeps the outliers, activations quantized on the fly, the
      int8 GEMM, one rescale per row after it (fused). Strata's earlier int8 DPAS kernel lost because it rescaled
      after every 32-element block inside the GEMM; this rescales once. Error there: 0.17% (rotations in fp32).
      Parity: a tolerance, not bitwise (as the GEMM block scores, 2026-10-04).
- [ ] **Fused small kernels for decode** (the item below, with working references): there, per-head RMS norm +
      rotary in one kernel (22.7 -> 6.2 ms against separate ops), SwiGLU, gated residual add, norm + scale/shift.
      Here they would cut decode graph nodes (~2,500 per round, launch gaps 15-20% of a round). Their kernels are
      shaped for thousands of rows; decode has 1-6, so the fusion carries over, not the kernels.
- [ ] **int8 scores in the prompt attention** (lower confidence): its attention quantizes q and k to int8 (k's
      sequence mean taken out first) and gains 1.6x at long sequences. This port's KV is already int8 and the
      per-cell kernel is arithmetic-bound; if it widens K to float for q.k, a per-head int8 q with dp4a would cut
      the scores half (the values pass, ~60% of the kernel, unchanged). Check what the kernel does first.

## 5. Another SYCL fork's experiments: maxious/Strata_SYCL

https://github.com/maxious/Strata_SYCL, branch `b70-intel-arc-0139`: built on this port's `intel-arc-0.1.39`, with
its own experiments on top (2026-10-05): "experiments 42-46" measured on an Arc Pro B60; int8 DPAS benches (a Q6_K
MMVQ, a fused gate+up, a prompt-width sweep); the host-flag spin priced (an exhaustion counter, a doorbell probe).

- [x] Fetched and read (2026-10-05): 210 files on top of `baa84d9`, with an experiments log
      (`docs/sycl-experiments/`, 42-46 measured on the B60) and engine opt-ins: `STRATA_MMVQ_PREUNPACK`,
      `STRATA_PREFILL_INT8`, `STRATA_PREFILL_MMQ`, `STRATA_GDN_PIPELINE` (default on there), `STRATA_REORDER_ESIMD`.
- [x] **Their DPAS / pre-unpack decode matvec on this box:** `xmx_mmvq_bench` on the B65 (the B70's die) at decode
      widths 3-8: DPAS 1.24-1.90x the shipped Q6_K kernel on the real shapes (2560->12288/10240, 6144->2560), the
      one-time pre-unpack (their exp 27, dp4a kept) 1.11-1.76x - most of the gain; DPAS loses on 2560 x 2560. All arms
      at the same error against fp64. **But not worth taking for decode on a 32 GB card:** their engine A/B found the
      unpacked copies cost 2.53 GiB of VRAM, the expert cache shrinks (9,478 -> 8,152 slots there) and decode drops
      12.4%; at matched slot counts within 1%. DPAS needs the same bytes (272 per 256 weights), so the same VRAM.
      Worth it only where VRAM is spare (the B65 beside a layer split, a 48 GB card).
- [x] **The Q6_K / Q5_K decode options are in this port, off by default** (2026-10-05; their code, credited):
      `STRATA_MMVQ_PREUNPACK`, `STRATA_MMVQ_LOOP`, the pre-unpack parity tests (`q6k_preunpack_parity`,
      `q5k_preunpack_parity`: pass on the B65) and `xmx_mmvq_bench`. Default path unchanged on the B70 (Coder k8v4:
      916 / 75.2 tok/s at 2,185 against 918 / 75.2 before, the same drafts accepted); `STRATA_MMVQ_PREUNPACK=1`: 1,313
      fewer cache slots, decode 72.0 (-4%). INTEL.md, "Q6_K / Q5_K decode options".
- [ ] Their DPAS int8 matvec (exp 42) wired into the engine as a second opt-in, for cards with VRAM to spare.
- [x] **Their branch's switches A/B'd on the B70** (Coder k8v4, their engine, 2,185 / 40K tokens): none beats this
      port. Their defaults decode 74.8 / **36.5** tok/s against this port's 75.2 / 69.2: at 40K their build ran one
      speculation round and then decoded without drafts ("1 rounds of 6", 0 accepted; this port: 91 rounds, 73%) - a
      regression on their branch worth reporting to them. `STRATA_GDN_PIPELINE=0` changes nothing measurable;
      `STRATA_PREFILL_MMQ=1` reads prompts at 156 tok/s (6-10x slower); `STRATA_PREFILL_INT8=1` stops at load
      ("device buffers for a chunk of 2304 tokens do not fit" - its buffers are not sized into the 256K config's
      budget, like this port's sel_S bug of 2026-10-04).
- [ ] The spin pricing (exp 46: the handshake ~1.4% of a round, exhaustion-dominant) against this port's doorbell.

## Later

- Fewer decode graph nodes (norm+rope, scores+top-k, gate+quantize fused): launch gaps are 15-20% of a round. See 4.
- Two draft branches per verify window (decode is latency-bound).
